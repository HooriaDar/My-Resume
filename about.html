<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr/>
<p>I am a Computer Science undergraduate at Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute with a strong passion for technology, creativity, and problem-solving.
My academic journey has allowed me to build a solid foundation in programming, data structures, and software development, while also sharpening
my critical thinking and analytical skills.</p>
<p>I enjoy exploring the intersection of technology and creativity, whether through designing user-friendly applications, working on collaborative
projects, or experimenting with innovative ideas. I am particularly motivated by challenges that require both logical reasoning and creative solutions,
and I continuously seek opportunities to learn new tools, languages, and frameworks to broaden my skill set.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, I aspire to contribute to impactful projects that leverage technology to solve real-world problems. I am eager to gain hands-on
experience through internships, research, and collaborations that will prepare me for a successful career in computer science. My goal is to grow
into a well-rounded professional who not only develops solutions but also inspires innovation and positive change.</p>
